# Simulation Goal
This simulation is representing how one factor which may seem unrelated to another factor. The simulation will be representing the impacts of temperature and rainfall on the size the beak of a bird.

## Berries

The size of the berries is dependent on the level of rainfall.

As rainfall increases, more berries grow.

### Formula for finding the size of the berries:

As the number of berries grown increases, the average size of berry the decreases.

Vice versa, as the number of berries grown decreases, the average size of the reduces.

## Rainfall

As mentioned before, the rainfall, as well as the average temperature is the dependent factor of this simulation. This project will allow you to chose the amount of precipitation.

As the rainfall increases, there will be more berries.

## Birds
The number of birds present in the simulation will be dependent on the number of berries. As more berries grow, there will be an increase in the number of birds.

### Bird Beak
The average size of the bird beak is the end goal of the simulation, and the dependent factor of the simulation.

The size of the berries impacts the size of the bird's beak. As the size of the berries increase, so will the size of the beak of the birds.


## Temperature
The optimal temperature for growth of berries is between 20°C and 30°C. The desired temperature for the best rate of growth is 25°C.
